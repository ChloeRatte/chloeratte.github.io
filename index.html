<h1> Hello! I'm Chloe.</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/index.php?s=6&p=001901">webcomics</a>, reading, writing, and, now, coding! I am a rising junior at <a href="http://bhs.bloomfield.schooldesk.net/">Bloomfield High</a>, where I took an introductory java course. I have one younger brother, a cat, and a tortoise. I am now in girls who code, and have completed multiple Scratch projects. I hope to enjoy my time here.</p>
