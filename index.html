<h1 id = "purple" > Hello! I'm Chloe.</h1>
<h2 id = "cent"> About me</h2>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/index.php?s=6&p=001901">webcomics</a>, reading, writing, and, now, coding! I am a rising junior at <a href="http://bhs.bloomfield.schooldesk.net/">Bloomfield High</a>, where I took an introductory java course. I have one younger brother, a cat, and a tortoise. I am now in girls who code, and have completed multiple Scratch projects. I hope to enjoy my time here.</p>
<h3>My School: </h3>
<p>Foods: pizza, steak tacos</p> 
<p>Drinks: Hot chocolate, lemonade, water</p>  
<p>Books: Aristotle and Dante...</p>
<h4> School Life</h4>
<p>Like I said previously, I will be a junior come September. That means I will have to tackle four AP classes in addition </p>
