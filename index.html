<p  id = "cent"> My full name is Chloe Jade Ratte, and I live in New Jersey with my mom, dad, and brother. I love webcomics, reading, writing, and, now, coding! I am a rising junior at <a href="http://bhs.bloomfield.schooldesk.net/">Bloomfield High</a>, where I took an introductory java course. I have one younger brother, a cat, and a tortoise. I am now in girls who code, and have completed multiple Scratch projects. I hope to enjoy my time here.</p>
